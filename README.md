<h2>If you are reviewing this project:</h2>
<p>there are some stuff you might want to know,<p/>
<ol>
<li>This project uses AI for fixing bugs and help me implement features that are hard to do especially in the backend, however i still type the code myself.</li>
<li>This project uses vanilla CSS with some libraries for the frontend styling, this is hard to do because all styling need to be written manually.</li>
</ol>
<h2>For the fraud department:</h2>
<p>Thanks for viewing my project, if you guys found something suspicious in my project, just wanted to say that I always check how the ui looks with changes written in the css styling because I want the ui looks as good as I want. Another thing for you guys to know that I DID NOT do <i>time inflation</i> on purposes, my first project was flagged with no valid reasons, hope you guys know I commits too often because of this, haha.</p>
